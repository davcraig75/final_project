# Final Project Outline
## Title
Differential Gene Expression in TCGA within Stage 1 Lung Adenocarcinomas comparing heavy and light smokers using DeSEQ2

## Author
David W Craig

## Overview of project

I will identify differentially expressed genes between Lung Cancer Adenocarcomas for heavy smokers and vs. light smokers. This analysis will utilize the package DeSEQ2 and follow the specific vignette: [http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html](DESEQ). For this analysis, I'll use the TCGA cohort and have identified 388 ht-seq counts files for tumors that fit within my cohort with 121 light smokers and 271 heavy smokers. Within the analysis, I will control for race and ethnicity.

> Please make sure you have identified the type of file you need for the vignette and that these are available.  This has been redacted from this README.

## Data

I will use the data from [https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository). Examining clinical data, there are 388 tumor samples, and 121 are defined by me as light smokers and 271 are identified as heavy smokers. The specific files are available are here [redacted].

> Please make sure you have examined and downloaded at least one dataset and you have identified which RNA-seq files you'll need.

## Milestone 1

> You should define your milestone based on your initial view of the data.

**Due Date:** Thursday November 11th

** Data fully loaded into vignette through HT-SEQ steps ** I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.


## Milestone 2

> You should define your milestone 2 which should be an initial running of the entire vignette for feedback.

**An initial completion of vignette.** I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.Data loaded into vignette (through htseq), for seeking feedback.  Not all sections in the writing will be completed, but will be final project.


## Deliverable

**Due Date:** December 3rd

A complete repository with clear documentation and description of your analysis and results.
